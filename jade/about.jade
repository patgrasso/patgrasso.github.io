    h2 About
    p I am currently a Junior pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in
      | Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology.
    br
    p I have a particular interest for 
      span.blue-box full-stack web development
      | , including everything from database interfacing to front-end design.
    br
    p Much of my personal experience has been with 
      span.blue-box JavaScript/Node.js
      |  and various frameworks,
      | however my professional experience at 
      a.red-box(target='_blank' href='http://icims.com') iCIMS
      |  has consisted mostly of 
      span.brown-text Java 
        i.fa.fa-coffee
      | .
    br
    p For the past year (two semesters) I have been the 
      span.red-box teaching assistant
      |  for CS 385 - Algorithms at Stevens.
    br
    p I have competed twice now (2014 and 2015) in the ACM International
      | Collegiate Programming Contest, representing Stevens.
    br
    p From these experiences and many more, I have developed an understanding
      | and appreciation for the beauty of various types of algorithms and data
      | structures as well as a knack for identifying and comparing solutions
      | to problems. I have a passion for learning concepts, frameworks, and
      | various technologies that allow me to create software, whether it be a
      | system program that interacts with an external device, or a web
      | application with an aesthetically appealing user interface.
